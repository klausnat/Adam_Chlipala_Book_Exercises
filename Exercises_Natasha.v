in the last exercise, and add an if expression form taking as arguments one b o olean
expression and two natural numb er expressions. Define semantics and constant-folding
functions for this new language. Your constant folding should simplify not just binary
op erations (returning naturals or b o oleans) with known arguments, but also "if"  ex-
pressions with known values for their test expressions but p ossibly undetermined "then"
and "else" cases. Prove that constant-folding a natural numb er expression preserves its
